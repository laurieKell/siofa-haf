Effective management strategies for Centroscymnus coelolepis, a deep-sea shark species characterised by slow growth and a long lifespan, is encumbered by the paucity and inconsistency of catch data. These deficiencies hinder the application of conventional quantitative assessment methods, such as biomass dynamic models, which necessitate comprehensive time series of stock removals and unbiaased indices of abundance. Enhanced observer coverage, although potentially helpful in quantifying removals, may fail to compensate for the absence of a fisheries-independent abundance index, further complicated by the species' low population growth rate which result in a delayed response to management actions.

The hierarchical assessment framework, proposed can serve as an appropriate approach for managing data-limited stocks like Centroscymnus coelolepis. The framework takes into account the availability and quality of data to determine suitable assessment methods and the potential use of empirical Harvest Control Rules (HCRs) that incorporate length indicators and indices of abundance to set catches. Currently data are available for length, catch and effort. Length samples can be used to develop LBIs and methods, which can give insights into the population structure and exploitation levels without the need for age data.

The lack of relaiable abundance indices and catch data means that biomass dynamic models can not be used. With improved observer data biomass dynamic models could potentially be applied with priors based on expert knowledge or historical data. Catch-Only Methods (COM) are not ideal for Centroscymnus coelolepis due to their reliance on catch data, which are often inconsistent and incomplete. The validation of COM is also near impossible, undermining their reliability for management decisions.The use of Length-Based Indicators (LBIs) may offer a viable interim solution for stock assessment and management. LBIs can provide insights into the population structure and exploitation levels without requiring age compostion data.


The hierarchical framework underscores the importance of obtaining better data to inform assessments, with the integration of expert knowledge and the development of models that incorporate life-history traits and ecological roles offering potential pathways for improved management. For Centroscymnus coelolepis, the framework highlights the need for length samples and independent indices of abundance to inform better assessments and management decisions. 


Given these challenges, alternative approaches that can accommodate sparse data and the unique biological characteristics of Centroscymnus coelolepis are necessitated for effective management. Such approaches might include the development of models that incorporate life-history traits and ecological roles, the use of length-based indicators (LBIs) for assessing exploitation levels, or the integration of expert elicitation and Bayesian methods to improve model inputs. Additionally, adopting a precautionary approach to management, enhancing research and monitoring efforts, and engaging in stakeholder collaboration can collectively contribute to more informed and adaptive management strategies for Centroscymnus coelolepis, ensuring the sustainable management of this deep-sea species within the constraints of its data-limited status.


Understanding the life-history characteristics of Centroscymnus coelolepis—such as its growth rate, reproductive biology, and natural mortality—is critical. This information can inform management decisions by providing insights into the species' vulnerability to fishing pressures and resilience to exploitation. Life-history data can help develop more accurate models for population dynamics, which are essential for predicting the impacts of fishing on stock sustainability.

LBIs offer a valuable tool for assessing the status of fish stocks, especially in data-limited situations. These indicators, which include metrics such as average size of the catch, size at maturity, and the proportion of mature individuals in the catch, can provide insights into the population structure and exploitation level of the species. By monitoring changes in these indicators over time, managers can infer trends in stock size and fishing mortality, enabling them to adjust management measures as needed.

In the absence of comprehensive data, the input of experts who are familiar with the species and its ecosystem can be invaluable. This may include traditional ecological knowledge from local fishermen, insights from marine biologists specializing in deep-sea ecosystems, or conservationists focused on shark species. Such knowledge can fill gaps in scientific data, provide context for interpreting available information, and suggest new avenues for research and monitoring.

Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE), offer a way to test and compare the effectiveness of different management strategies under uncertainty. MSE combines simulation modeling with risk assessment to evaluate the potential outcomes of management actions, taking into account the biological, economic, and social implications. For Centroscymnus coelolepis, tailoring MSE to the species' specific context and data limitations allows for the exploration of various scenarios, including changes in fishing effort, gear modifications, and protected areas.

The combined application of these approaches represents a comprehensive framework for the sustainable management of Centroscymnus coelolepis. By addressing the unique challenges of managing data-limited deep-sea species, this strategy not only aims to ensure the long-term viability of Centroscymnus coelolepis populations but also contributes to the broader goal of sustainable deep-sea fisheries management. Such an approach underscores the importance of integrating scientific research, expert knowledge, and stakeholder engagement in developing adaptive and resilient management strategies. As fisheries management continues to evolve, embracing these innovative methods will be crucial for protecting vulnerable species like Centroscymnus coelolepis and their ecosystems.
