Effective management strategies for Centroscymnus coelolepis, a deep-sea shark species characterised by slow growth and a long lifespan, is encumbered by the paucity and inconsistency of catch data. These deficiencies hinder the application of conventional quantitative assessment methods, such as biomass dynamic models, which necessitate comprehensive time series of stock removals and unbiaased indices of abundance. Enhanced observer coverage, although potentially helpful in quantifying removals, may fail to compensate for the absence of a fisheries-independent abundance index, further complicated by the species' low population growth rate which result in a delayed response to management actions.

The hierarchical assessment framework, proposed can serve as an appropriate approach for managing data-limited stocks like Centroscymnus coelolepis. The framework takes into account the availability and quality of data to determine suitable assessment methods and the potential use of empirical Harvest Control Rules (HCRs) that incorporate length indicators and indices of abundance to set catches. Currently data are available for length, catch and effort. Length samples can be used to develop LBIs and methods, which can give insights into the population structure and exploitation levels without the need for age data.

The lack of relaiable abundance indices and catch data means that biomass dynamic models can not be used. With improved observer data biomass dynamic models could potentially be applied with priors based on expert knowledge or historical data. Catch-Only Methods (COM) are not ideal for Centroscymnus coelolepis due to their reliance on catch data, which are often inconsistent and incomplete. The validation of COM is also near impossible, undermining their reliability for management decisions.The use of Length-Based Indicators (LBIs) may offer a viable interim solution for stock assessment and management. LBIs can provide insights into the population structure and exploitation levels without requiring age compostion data.


The hierarchical framework underscores the importance of obtaining better data to inform assessments, with the integration of expert knowledge and the development of models that incorporate life-history traits and ecological roles offering potential pathways for improved management. For Centroscymnus coelolepis, the framework highlights the need for length samples and independent indices of abundance to inform better assessments and management decisions. 


Given these challenges, alternative approaches that can accommodate sparse data and the unique biological characteristics of Centroscymnus coelolepis are necessitated for effective management. Such approaches might include the development of models that incorporate life-history traits and ecological roles, the use of length-based indicators (LBIs) for assessing exploitation levels, or the integration of expert elicitation and Bayesian methods to improve model inputs. Additionally, adopting a precautionary approach to management, enhancing research and monitoring efforts, and engaging in stakeholder collaboration can collectively contribute to more informed and adaptive management strategies for Centroscymnus coelolepis, ensuring the sustainable management of this deep-sea species within the constraints of its data-limited status.


Understanding the life-history characteristics of Centroscymnus coelolepis—such as its growth rate, reproductive biology, and natural mortality—is critical. This information can inform management decisions by providing insights into the species' vulnerability to fishing pressures and resilience to exploitation. Life-history data can help develop more accurate models for population dynamics, which are essential for predicting the impacts of fishing on stock sustainability.

LBIs offer a valuable tool for assessing the status of fish stocks, especially in data-limited situations. These indicators, which include metrics such as average size of the catch, size at maturity, and the proportion of mature individuals in the catch, can provide insights into the population structure and exploitation level of the species. By monitoring changes in these indicators over time, managers can infer trends in stock size and fishing mortality, enabling them to adjust management measures as needed.

In the absence of comprehensive data, the input of experts who are familiar with the species and its ecosystem can be invaluable. This may include traditional ecological knowledge from local fishermen, insights from marine biologists specializing in deep-sea ecosystems, or conservationists focused on shark species. Such knowledge can fill gaps in scientific data, provide context for interpreting available information, and suggest new avenues for research and monitoring.

Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE), offer a way to test and compare the effectiveness of different management strategies under uncertainty. MSE combines simulation modeling with risk assessment to evaluate the potential outcomes of management actions, taking into account the biological, economic, and social implications. For Centroscymnus coelolepis, tailoring MSE to the species' specific context and data limitations allows for the exploration of various scenarios, including changes in fishing effort, gear modifications, and protected areas.

The combined application of these approaches represents a comprehensive framework for the sustainable management of Centroscymnus coelolepis. By addressing the unique challenges of managing data-limited deep-sea species, this strategy not only aims to ensure the long-term viability of Centroscymnus coelolepis populations but also contributes to the broader goal of sustainable deep-sea fisheries management. Such an approach underscores the importance of integrating scientific research, expert knowledge, and stakeholder engagement in developing adaptive and resilient management strategies. As fisheries management continues to evolve, embracing these innovative methods will be crucial for protecting vulnerable species like Centroscymnus coelolepis and their ecosystems.

Deepwater Sharks Workshop (WS2023-DWS) Tenerife, Spain, 20-21 March 2023

Under Agenda item 3.3. Development of a risk assessment framework (e.g., Productivity Susceptibility Analysis (PSA)) the paper “A hierarchical stock assessment risk framework for deepwater sharks” (WSDWS-2023-06) was presented. 
A summary of this document was included in the report 
23. The EU presented WSDWS-2023-06, which proposed a stock assessment advice framework that is consistent with various international agreements and can be applied to a variety of stocks and species, both bycaught and targeted, across a range of fisheries and management bodies. The framework combines a Productivity Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) with a hierarchical stock assessment framework.

24. The first step is to use the PSA as a risk screening exercise to prioritise stocks and to evaluate potential mitigation measures. It is proposed to include estimates of uncertainty and to adopt a risk approach to allow the identification of uncertainties and knowledge gaps that impact on management objectives. Although a PSA can help identify species at risk and the benefit of potential mitigation measures, it does not provide estimates of current stock status levels relative to target and limit reference points, required to estimate fishing pressure and impacts, such as for predicting the consequences of alternative management actions, and monitoring the response of a stock to management. Therefore, a hierarchical assessment framework is proposed that can be applied to a range of data-limited, moderate and rich situations. Quantitative PSA, length-based indicators, biomass dynamic models or more complex models should be considered. The framework will follow the principle of risk equivalence, defined as the probability of a stock being depleted below a limit reference point or not being maintained at a target reference point being equal, irrespective of the stock assessment method used to provide management advice and the amount of data available. 

A paper was presented by Australia, that detailed the current work on, the “Sustainability Assessment for Fishing Effects” (SAFE), an extension of the PSA approach.  

25. Australia presented WSDWS-2023-03, which provided an update on the ecological risk assessment (ERA) of deepwater chondrichthyan species that was last presented at the second meeting of the Stock Assessment and Ecological Risk Assessment Working Group (SERAWG) in March 2020 (See SERAWG-02-10). The updated assessment uses PSA and Sustainability Assessment for Fishing Effects (SAFE) to assess the risk of chondrichthyans to demersal trawl, midwater trawl, “shallow demersal trawl” (Saya de Malha bank fishery), demersal longline and pelagic longline gears (targeting oilfish) in SIOFA fisheries. 
WSDWS-2023-06 is building on the SAFE approach to conduct stock assessment to assess the response of a stock to management measures. There was confusion over the terms PSA, ERA and SAFE. InWSDWS-2023-06 the term PSA refers to a generic approach based on estimating productivity and susceptibility. These quantities can be estimated in a variety of ways, for example  using the SAFE approach which uses life history parameters to estimate natural mortality (M) and then uses this to derive a proxies for fishing mortality reference points.  WSDWS-2023-03 also uses life history parameters and relationships but uses these to estimate priors for stock assessment methods using a consistent approach that allows the value-of-information to be evaluated and risk equivalence to be considered. The WG recognised this i.e.

28. The Workshop encouraged the EU and Australia to coordinate and share information with each other as they continue to develop their respective risk assessment methods.
A number of relevant recommendations were also made to the Scientific Committee, these included
72. The Workshop recommended that the SC:
    i. note that Australia has updated the chondrichthyan ERA following the provision of new catch and effort data for the period 2015-2019.
    ii. note minor revisions have been made to the methodology, but improved distribution data in 2022 allowed comparison of individual species risk rankings across various mapping sources (AquaMaps, FAO GeoNetwork and IUCN).
    iii. note several chondrichthyan species were classified as either at high or extreme risk in SAFE across SIOFA fisheries with some of these species (e.g., Dalatias licha) still reported as retained in large numbers in the SIOFA Area (Annex C)
    iv. note the choice of mapping source (AquaMaps, FAO GeoNetwork and IUCN) had a significant effect on the species assessed at high or extreme risk in each fishery, and therefore, the choice of distribution mapping source has a major influence on assessment of overall species-level risk.
    v. further investigate the methods used by the different mapping sources to assess the underlying reliability of their predicted distributions and subsequently, what the most appropriate mapping source for deepwater chondrichthyans is in the SIOFA Area.
    vi. recommend to the MoP that, as a precautionary measure, that catches of Centrophorus granulosus, Dalatias licha and Deania calceus be managed until further analysis can be conducted to determine the sustainable catch.
    vii. conduct future updates to Australia’s chondrichthyan ERAs using solely the SAFE tool given that SAFE is a more quantitative approach that reduces the likelihood of false positives and difficulties in determining “risk equivalence” as in the PSA, without precluding other studies from being conducted with other methodologies.

84 The Workshop recommended that the SC conduct further research to better understand the habitats and behaviour of deepwater sharks in this area, such as nursery grounds, areas were females concentrate, hotspots, etc., towards informing measures such as the setting of spatial management measures and protection of large, especially pregnant females. 

The next steps therefore will be to work with others to
    I. Develop priors based on life history parameters that are consistent with the quantities used in the “PSA/ERA/SAFE” approach. This will help when conducting stock assessment to monitor the effectiveness of management measures, by ensuring risk equivalence. This requires considering uncertainty in reference points, since limits have to be avoided with high probabilty and so the tails of the distributions need to be estimated not just the central tendencies as is done for targets.  The approach will also allow the benefits of improved knowledge of biological parameters obtained via the tagging programme to be evaluated, and for tagging studies to be adapted based on knowledge gained.
    II. Evaluate the robustness of the different mapping tools, as these produce different estimates of vulnerability. It is therefore necessary to validate the methods and assumptions used by each tool. For example, this could be done by predicting the results from the tagging studies, i.e. can the mapping methods predict the observations. Following which, the tagging data can be used to update the mapping methods can be considered. It should also allow potential adaptation of the programme to be proposed.
    III. Use the “PSA/ERA/SAFE” approach to evaluate the
        a) value-of-information by including uncertainty about estimates of productivity and propagate this into the estimates of reference points.
        b) value-of-control by comparing alternative mitigation measure, i.e. how does vulnerability change. This will need to include appropraite forms of uncertainty due to lack of information on key parameters and about the resource and ability to control fishing 
        c) risk equivalence, by using the estimates of productivity in stock assessment in the form of Bayesian priors that can be updated as new data become available
    IV. share code via gihub


Another Item was
79. The Workshop recommended that, if the aim is to define a commercial Portuguese dogfish fishery and to take measures to ensure it is sustainably managed, the SC should enhance biological data collection efforts and conduct CPUE and other relevant analyses towards conducting a stock assessment to determine the sustainable level of Portuguese dogfish catch. The outcomes of the EU project as presented in MoP9-Info-15 will help on the elaboration of scientific advice.  
Dogfish fisheries exist in different oceans and regions, so valuable informarion could be quickly gathered to assembled a st of prior information for this stock. This will be an example of how the hiercahical framework can be used, for example as part of the SMEFF regulations.
